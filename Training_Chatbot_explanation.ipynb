    "<font size=\"3\"> There are a lot of ways to create chatbots but most of the ways require too much data and computing. In this notebook, we’ll show a simplistic chatbot using an intent-based database. You can modify the dataset and try the chatbot on your own problems. The dataset is contained in the intents.json file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chatbot, we are not trying to generate the text by understanding the question but we are only trying to understand the intent of the question or trying to predict the tag of the question. Knowing the tag can give us the idea of what kind of question are we talking about, once the tags are identified, a response can be picked up from the sample responses attached with each tag. So, in the true sense, it is a tag predictor problem but if the dataset is formatted properly it can work as a brilliant chatbot, it may not work as a general-purpose chatbot but it can definitely work as a task-based chatbot meaning a chatbot trained to answer questions on one or two topics. Real chatbots which function like Siri or OK Google require terabytes of training data thus creating a chatbot with intent is the best option for people with less computing power.<br><br>\n",

    "Without further ado let’s dive into our code. We already Loaded the libraries. Let's load the dataset, which is in the format of a JSON file, and see what our data looks like. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<font size=\"3\"> Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. Putting it differently: Lemmatization is the process of converting a word to its base form. Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meanings to one word. The difference between stemming and lemmatization is, lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, whereas stemming just removes the last few characters, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lemmatization would correctly identify the base form of ‘caring’ to ‘care’, whereas, stemming would cutoff the ‘ing’ part and convert it to car. ‘Caring’ -> Lemmatization -> ‘Care’ ‘Caring’ -> Stemming -> ‘Car’"

    "\n",
    "<font size=\"3\"> Pickle is used for serializing and de-serializing Python object structures, also called marshalling or flattening. Serialization refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network. Later on, this character stream can then be retrieved and de-serialized back to a Python object. Pickling is not to be confused with compression! The former is the conversion of an object from one representation (data in Random Access Memory (RAM)) to another (text on disk), while the latter is the process of encoding data with fewer bits, in order to save disk space. Pickling is useful for applications where you need some degree of persistency in your data. Your program's state data can be saved to disk, so you can continue working on it later on. It can also be used to send data over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or socket connection, or to store python objects in a database. Pickle is very useful for when you're working with machine learning algorithms, where you want to save them to be able to make new predictions at a later time, without having to rewrite everything or train the model all over again. <br><br>\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">To open the file for writing, simply use the open() function. The first argument should be the name of your file. The second argument is 'wb'. The w means that you'll be writing to the file, and b refers to binary mode. This means that the data will be written in the form of byte objects. If you forget the b, a TypeError: must be str, not bytes will be returned. You may sometimes come across a slightly different notation; w+b, but don't worry, it provides the same functionality. Once the file is opened for writing, you can use pickle.dump(), which takes two arguments: the object you want to pickle and the file to which the object has to be saved. In this case, the former will be dogs_dict, while the latter will be outfile."
